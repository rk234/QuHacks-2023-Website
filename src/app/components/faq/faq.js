                        answer={`A hackathon is a coding marathon - it's like a real-time programming fair where students develop an idea and bring it to life through code. A project could be a game, website, app, robot, Arduino project, whatever! If you enjoy programming or technology in general, hackathons are great places to meet friendly, like-minded people.`}

We will have both a novice division (set up specifically for those new to coding) and a main division, and the "Intro to Programming" workshop is tailor made for new programmers.`}
